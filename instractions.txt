Please create a React Native mobile application version of the game Simon Says (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLi1qnRmpe4).

The app will include two screens:
1.	Game screen, including:
- Four colored playing buttons (feel free to choose the shapes and colors).
- Start button.
- Current score (the current length of the active sequence).
2.	Results screen, including:
- A list of the 10 best results and the name of the player.
- A button redirecting to start a new game.
Some behavioural specifications:
- The sequence from Simon should be random (for each step one press is added with a random color).
- The sequence from Simon should increase by 1 for every successful try.
- If the user fails, navigate to the results screen with a popup (use a RN modal) for entering the player's name.
- The results should be persistent (not deleted when reopening the app).
- Add sound for game buttons actions (both Simon's and the user's).

Technical guidelines:
- Don't use Expo (use the React Native CLI Quickstart).
- Use Typescript, hooks.
- Use redux for the app's state management.
- Use react-navigation v5.
- Handle as many edge cases as possible (for example, the user shouldn't be able to press the buttons while Simon is doing his sequence).
 
Send me an Android APK (Google drive link or the file itself) and the project source code (GitHub, zip, etc..).
